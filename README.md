# mbedTLS
We have to change the already written mbedTLS library from C language to Rust. Rust is blazingly fast, memory efficient and secure language. mbedTLS is a implementation of TLS and SSL protocols. It is a open source SSL library.

My task is to convert one of the module of mbedTLS library ie. RNG (Random Number Generation) Module to Rust language.
